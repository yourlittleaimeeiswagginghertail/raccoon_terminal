Abstract: Lysosomal integral membrane protein-2 (LIMP-2), encoded by the SCARB2 gene, is the specific lysosomal receptor for glucocerebrosidase enzyme. Association between rs6812193 and rs68250047 of SCARB2 with PD has been shown in genetic studies, including large genome-wide association studies. The aim of the current study was to determine whether rs6812193 and rs8475 are associated with PD in Russia. rs6812193 and rs8475 were genotyped in a total of 604 PD patients (65 PD patients with positive (fPD) and 539 PD patients with negative family history (sPD)) and 413 controls and also in 17 patients with PD associated with GBA mutations (PD-GBA) and 18 asymptomatic GBA mutation carriers (GBA-Carriers). SCARB2 expression was measured by real-time PCR in CD45+ blood cells in part of individuals in the studied groups. No linkage disequilibrium was shown between rs6812193 and rs8475 in Russian population. Increased PD risk for TT variant of rs8475 (OR = 2.02; p < 0.001) was found in sPD patients but not in fPD. rs6812193 and rs8475 were not associated with age at onset (AAO) of PD. SCARB2 expression level was decreased in GBA-PD patients and GBA-Carriers compared to PD patients (padjusted = 0.02, padjusted = 0.003, respectively) and GBA-Carriers compared to controls (padjusted = 0.013) with no significant difference in PD patients and controls. SCARB2 expression was not modified with rs6812193 and rs8475. In conclusion, rs8475 was associated with PD status. rs6812193 and rs8475 are not genetic modifier of AAO of PD and do not influence on SCARB2 mRNA level in CD45+ blood cells in studied groups. SCARB2 expression could be modified with GBA mutations and is independent of PD status.

Abstract: Buspirone, a partial agonist of the 5-HT1aR, due to potential antinociceptive properties can be useful for abdominal pain treatment in IBS patients. Pain-related effects of buspirone can be mediated by the 5-HT1aRs, located within the nucleus tractus solitarius. The 5-HT1aR involvement in pain transmission within the NTS is unclear. The objective of our study was to evaluate the involvement of the 5-HT1aR in abdominal pain transmission within the NTS. Using a model of abdominal pain on urethane-anesthetized rats, two types of NTS pain-related neurons responding to the noxious colorectal distension (CRD) with excitatory and inhibitory sustained patterns of evoked activity were revealed. Buspirone (1.0–4.0 mg kg−1, iv) has complex time- and dose-depended action on the CRD-induced NTS neuron responses. Buspirone inhibits the responses of the excitatory neurons and inverts the responses of the inhibitory pain-related neurons but at a dose of 4.0 buspirone, the effect on NTS pain-related neurons attenuates. The inhibitory effect of buspirone on the CRD-evoked responses of the excitatory NTS neurons is completely blocked by an intra-cerebroventricular administration of buspirone agonist WAY100,635. The inhibitory responses do not change by this agonist. The inhibitory action of buspirone is mediated by supraspinal 5-HT1a receptors however, its excitatory effect on inhibitory neurons does not dependents on these receptors. We proposed that the NTS pain-related neurons could be involved in anti- or pronociceptive effects of buspirone on abdominal pain.

Abstract: Background
MicroRNA (miRNAs) participate in the pathogenesis of coronary artery disease (CAD).
Objective
To evaluate the expressions of myocardial and serum miRNA-27а, miRNA-133а, and miRNA-203 in CAD patients.
Method
This cross-sectional observational study comprised 100 subjects (60.9 ± 1.0 years; 67% men). The right atrial and serum expressions of miRNA-27a, miRNA -133a, and miRNA-203 in 80 patients referred for elective coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG) and 20 control patients scheduled for heart valve surgery were analyzed using real-time polymerase chain reaction.
Results
There was a positive correlation between the SYNTAX score I index and serum miRNA-203 expression level (r = 0.693; p < .001). Patients with ≥3 coronary artery lesions had significantly higher myocardial expressions of miRNA-27a, miRNA-133а, and miRNA-203 than patients with 1–2 vessel disease in the atrial myocardium (miRNA-27a: 234.62 ± 29.51 vs. 182.39 ± 19.62 relative expression unit (REU); miRNA-133а: 127.53 ± 13.41 vs. 111.35 ± 12.31 REU; and miRNA-203: 5.25 ± 0.96 vs. 4.71 ± 0.67 REU; р < 0.05); the same association was found for serum miRNA expressions (miRNA-27a: 11.41 ± 3.85 vs. 4.82 ± 1.82 REU; miRNA-133а: 8.42 ± 2.43 vs. 4.35 ± 1.23 REU; and miRNA-203: 145.71 ± 15.73 vs. 43.70 ± 9.67 REU; р < 0.05). The decision tree method established that the risk of multivessel lesions was increased five-fold if the miRNA-203 serum expression was >101.00 REU (OR, 5.90; 95% CI, 2.34–9.46; p < .001).
Conclusions
Both myocardial and serum miRNA-27а, miRNA-133а, and miRNA-203 expressions are higher in CABG patients than in non-CAD subjects. The serum miRNA-203 expression level corresponds to myocardial expression and is strongly correlated with the extent of coronary atherosclerosis.

Abstract: A series of binuclear PdII carbene complexes were synthesized via the treatment of cis-[PdCl2(CNXyl)2] (1) with benzo-1,3-thiazol-2-amines (2–6) and structurally characterized. In every case the reaction leads to the mixture of two regioisomers, which are able to interconvert. The study of the regioisomerization of the binuclear diaminocarbene species showed that it is a first-order reaction, that is, it occurs intramolecularly, and was analyzed with the Hammett function. Electron-withdrawing substituents in the benzothiazole moiety of the complexes as well as increasing the solvent polarity accelerate the reaction. The solvent donor strength correlates less well with the isomerization rates. Based on the obtained activation parameters the studied regioisomerization could be defined as the interchange/dissociative process type. A combined approach including kinetic and mass spectrometric studies allowed the conclusion that the rate-determining step of the isomerization is breaking the carbon–nitrogen bond in the carbene fragment of the binuclear complex.

Abstract: Aims
Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) ranks in the top 10 causes of mortality worldwide. The key factor of T2DM vascular complications is endothelial dysfunction. It is characterized by the vessels motor activity disruption and endothelium-derived factors imbalance. The blood vessels morphological and molecular heterogeneity greatly affects the changes occurring in T2DM. Therefore, we conducted a comparative study of vascular bed changes occurring in T2DM.
Main methods
Male Wistar rats were fed a high-fat diet for 20 weeks, followed by a single streptozotocin injection (20 mg/kg). T2DM was confirmed with an oral glucose tolerance test.
Key findings
A dose-dependent contraction study showed an increase in third-order mesenteric arterioles response to serotonin but not to phenylephrine. These vessels also exhibited a decrease in acetylcholine-dependent relaxation and an increase in guanylate cyclase function. At the same time, the femoral arteries showed a tendency for increased acetylcholine-dependent relaxation. The blood plasma analysis revealed low bioavailable nitric oxide and high levels of endothelin-1 and ROS.
Significance
This knowledge, in conjunction with the features of the T2DM course, can allow further targeted approaches development for the prevention and treatment of vascular complications occurring in the disease.

Abstract: Background
Lorlatinib is a novel potent ALK inhibitor, with only a few studies reporting the results of its clinical use.
Methods
This study describes the outcomes of lorlatinib treatment for 35 non-small cell lung cancer patients with ALK rearrangements, who had 2 (n = 5), 1 (n = 26) or none (n = 4) prior tyrosine kinase inhibitors and received lorlatinib mainly within the compassionate use program.
Results
Objective tumor response (OR) and disease control (DC) were registered in 15/35 (43%) and 33/35 (94%) patients, respectively; brain metastases were particularly responsive to the treatment (OR: 22/27 (81%); DC: 27/27 (100%)). Median progression free survival (PFS) was estimated to be 21.8 months, and median overall survival (OS) approached to 70.1 months. Only 4 out of 35 patients experienced no adverse effects; two of them were the only subjects who had no clinical benefit from lorlatinib. PFS and OS in the no-adverse-events lorlatinib users were strikingly lower as compared to the remaining patients (1.1 months vs. 23.7 months and 10.5 months vs. not reached, respectively; p < 0.0001 for both comparisons). ALK translocation variants were known for 28 patients; there was no statistical difference between patients with V.1 and V.3 rearrangements with regard to the OS or PFS.
Conclusion
Use of lorlatinib results in excellent disease outcomes, however caution must be taken for patients experiencing no adverse effects from this drug.

Abstract: Aims
The effects of three types of bariatric interventions on myocardial infarct size were tested in the rat model of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). We also evaluated the effects of bariatric surgery on no-reflow phenomenon and vascular dysfunction caused by T2DM.
Main methods
Rats with T2DM were assigned into groups: without surgery, sham-operated, ileal transposition, Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, and sleeve gastrectomy. Oral glucose tolerance, glucagon-like peptide-1, and insulin levels were measured. Six weeks after surgery, the animals were subjected to myocardial ischemia-reperfusion followed by histochemical determination of infarct size (IS), no-reflow zone, and blood stasis area size. Vascular dysfunction was characterized using wire myography.
Key findings
All bariatric surgery types caused significant reductions in animal body weight and resulted in T2DM compensation. All bariatric interventions partially normalized glucagon-like peptide-1 responses attenuated by T2DM. IS was significantly smaller in animals with T2DM. Bariatric surgery provided no additional IS limitation compared with T2DM alone. Bariatric surgeries reversed T2DM-induced enhanced contractile responses of the mesenteric artery to 5-hydroxytryptamine. Sleeve gastrectomy normalized decreased nitric oxide synthase contribution to the endothelium-dependent vasodilatation in T2DM.
Significance
T2DM resulted in a reduction of infarct size and no-reflow zone size. Bariatric surgery provided no additional infarct-limiting effect, but it normalized T2DM-induced augmented vascular contractility and reversed decreased contribution of nitric oxide to endothelium-dependent vasodilatation typical of T2DM. All taken together, we suggest that this type of surgery may have a beneficial effect on T2DM-induced cardiovascular diseases.

Abstract: The present study investigates the event-related oscillations underlying the motion-onset response (MOR) evoked by sounds moving at different velocities. EEG was recorded for stationary sounds and for three patterns of sound motion produced by changes in interaural time differences. We explored the effect of motion velocity on the MOR potential, and also on the event-related spectral perturbation (ERSP) and inter-trial phase coherence (ITC) calculated from the time-frequency decomposition of EEG signals. The phase coherence of slow oscillations increased with an increase in motion velocity similarly to the magnitude of cN1 and cP2 components of the MOR response. The delta-to-alpha inter-trial spectral power remained at the same level up to, but not including, the highest velocity, suggesting that gradual spatial changes within the sound did not induce non-coherent activity. Conversely, the abrupt sound displacement induced theta-alpha oscillations which had low phase consistency. The findings suggest that the MOR potential could be mainly generated by the phase resetting of slow oscillations, and the degree of phase coherence may be considered as a neurophysiological indicator of sound motion processing.

Abstract: It is currently thought that a full glycogen molecule (β-particle) has a spherical shape with 12 concentric tiers of glucose residues with glycogenin in the center and diameter of about 42 nm. However, the spatial structure of the β-particle remains poorly understood. In this study, the structure of glycogen β-particles in hepatocytes of starved and fed rats has been studied using in situ cytofluorometry technique and measurement of speed of glycogen staining with the Schiff's reagent. Based on the results of these measurements we suggest a novel model of spatial structure of glycogen molecules in which quickly stained, labile fraction of glycogen (LF) represents residues located at the internal tiers of the molecule, while slowly stained, stable fraction of molecule (SF) represents residues at the external tiers of the molecule and associated with proteins. This model predicts that in the starved rats the 3rd and 4th tiers glucose residues (42% of all) are bound to proteins. In the fed rats on 7th and 8th tiers together ~19% of glucose residues were bound to proteins. The external tier of glycogen molecules was never free of proteins and the enzyme amount on the particle surface was variable. Thus, using this cytofluorometry method makes it possible to study the spatial structure of glycogen in situ and to obtain data on its features in this particular cell.

Abstract: Background Eculizumab, a terminal complement inhibitor, significantly reduced the risk of relapse compared with placebo in patients with anti-aquaporin-4 immunoglobulin G-positive (AQP4+) neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD) in the PREVENT trial. We report efficacy and safety analyses in Asian patients in PREVENT and its open-label extension (OLE). Methods PREVENT was a double-blind, randomized, phase 3 trial. Patients with AQP4+ NMOSD were randomly assigned (2:1) to receive intravenous eculizumab (maintenance dose, 1200 mg/2 weeks) or placebo. Patients who completed PREVENT could receive eculizumab in an OLE. Analyses were performed in a prespecified subgroup of Asian patients. Results Of 143 patients enrolled, 52 (36.4%) were included in the Asian subgroup (eculizumab, n = 37; placebo, n = 15); 45 Asian patients received eculizumab in the OLE. Most Asian patients (86.5%) received concomitant immunosuppressive therapy. During PREVENT, one adjudicated relapse occurred in patients receiving eculizumab and six occurred in patients receiving placebo in the Asian subgroup (hazard ratio, 0.05; 95% confidence interval: 0.01–0.35; p = 0.0002). An estimated 95.2% of Asian patients remained relapse-free after 144 weeks of eculizumab treatment. Upper respiratory tract infections, headache, and nasopharyngitis were the most common adverse events with eculizumab in the Asian subgroup. Conclusion Eculizumab reduces the risk of relapse in Asian patients with AQP4+ NMOSD, with a benefit–risk profile similar to the overall PREVENT population. The benefits of eculizumab were maintained during long-term therapy. Clinical trial registration ClinicalTrials.gov identifiers: NCT01892345 (PREVENT); NCT02003144 (open-label extension).

Abstract: The task is to identify differences in phase synchronization between the intermittent photic stimulation and a response of the brain of patients with arterial hypertension and manifestations of moderate cognitive impairment and without such manifestations. To solve the task we used the recurrence based phase synchronization index, the ratio of instantaneous frequencies, the duration and the phase synchronization index obtained after the synchrosqueezed wavelet transform of the EEG patterns and the light time series. We have shown that moderate cognitive impairment correlates with a greater degree of phase synchronization. This is manifested in an increase in the index and duration of phase synchronization between intermittent photostimulation and bioelectric activity of the brain, as well as with a shift in this activity to a lower frequency range compared to the excitation frequency. The results can be used for clinical assessment of the degree of moderate cognitive impairment of vascular origin.

Abstract: Migraine is associated with the activation and sensitisation of the trigeminovascular system and is often accompanied by mechanical hyperalgesia and allodynia. The mechanisms of mechanotransduction during a migraine attack are yet unknown. We have proposed that the ion channel Piezo1 may be involved, since it is expressed in endothelial cells as well as in trigeminal ganglion neurons, and thus, may contribute to the activation of both the vascular and neuronal component of the trigeminovascular system. We took advantage of extracellular recordings from the trigeminocervical complex – a key relay centre in the migraine pain pathway, to directly assess the impact of the differently applied Piezo1 agonist Yoda1 on the sensory processing at the spinal level. At a low dose, Yoda1 slightly facilitated the ongoing firing of central trigeminovascular neurons, however, at a high dose, this substance contributed to the suppression of their activity. Using intravital microscopy, we have revealed that Yoda1 at high dose can also induce the dilation of meningeal arteries innervated by trigeminal afferents. Collectively, here we have identified both neuronal and vascular modulation via selective activation of mechanosensitive Piezo1 channels, which provide new evidence in favour of the Piezo1 role in migraine pathogenesis. We propose several mechanisms that may underlie the revealed effects of Yoda1.

Abstract: Silica is silicon dioxide, which, depending on the production method, can exist in various amorphous forms with varying specific surface area, particle size, pore volume and size, and, as a result, with different physicochemical and sorption characteristics. The presence of silanol groups on the surface of silicas provides the possibility of its further functionalisation. In addition, the developed specific surface of Aerosil allows to obtain composites with a high content of biologically active substances. In this work, we studied the biocompatibility of a composite based on Aerosil 380 and carboxylated fullerene C60[C(COOH)2]3, namely: haemolysis (spontaneous and photoinduced), platelet aggregation, binding to HSA, cyto- and genotoxicity, antiradical activity. Interest in the creation of this nanomaterial is due to the fact that carboxylated fullerenes have potential applications in various fields of biomedicine, including the ability to bind reactive oxygen species, inhibition of tumour development, inactivation of viruses and bacteria. The obtained composite can be used for the immobilisation of various drugs and the further development of drugs for theranostics.

Abstract: TNF-α is the key inflammatory cytokine. TNF-α receptors are expressed in brain stem regions involved in respiratory control and also in the carotid bodies, which are the sensory organs monitoring arterial blood O2. We hypothesised that the circulating tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-α may affect the lung ventilation and modulate the hypoxic ventilatory response via activation of cyclooxygenase (COX) and nitric oxide synthase (NOS) pathways. The aim of the current study was to compare the respiratory effects of TNF-α before and after pretreatment with diclofenac or L-NG-nitro arginine methyl ester (L-NAME) nonspecific inhibitors of COX and NOS, respectively. The hypoxic ventilatory response was measured in anaesthetised rats using rebreathing techniques. We found that TNF-α increased the lung ventilation in normoxia but decreased the ventilatory response to hypoxia. Pretreatment with each of these inhibitors reduced respiratory effects of TNF-α. We believe that activation of COX and NOS-related pathways and also “cross-talk” between them mediates the TNF-α respiratory effects and underlies the impact of inflammation on the respiratory function.

Abstract: ABSTRACT
HLA-haploidentical transplantation (haplo-HCT) using post-transplantation-cyclophosphamide (PT-Cy) is a feasible procedure in children with malignancies. However, large studies on Haplo-HCT with PT-Cy for childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) are lacking. We analyzed haplo-HCT outcomes in 180 children with ALL. Median age was 9 years, and median follow-up was 2.7 years. Disease status was CR1 for 24%, CR2 for 45%, CR+3 for 12%, and active disease for 19%. All patients received PT-Cy day +3 and +4. Bone marrow (BM) was the stem cell source in 115 patients (64%). Cumulative incidence of 42-day engraftment was 88.9%. Cumulative incidence of day-100 acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) grade II-IV was 28%, and 2-year chronic GVHD was 21.9%. At 2 years, cumulative incidence of nonrelapse mortality (NRM) was 19.6%. Cumulative incidence was 41.9% for relapse and 25% for patients in CR1. Estimated 2-year leukemia free survival was 65%, 44%, and 18.8% for patients transplanted in CR1, CR2, CR3+ and 3% at 1 year for active disease. In multivariable analysis for patients in CR1 and CR2, disease status (CR2 [hazard ratio {HR} = 2.19; P = .04]), age at HCT older than 13 (HR = 2.07; P = .03) and use of peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) (HR = 1.98; P = .04) were independent factors associated with decreased overall survival. Use of PBSC was also associated with higher NRM (HR = 3.13; P = .04). Haplo-HCT with PT-Cy is an option for children with ALL, namely those transplanted in CR1 and CR2. Age and disease status remain the most important factors for outcomes. BM cells as a graft source is associated with improved survival.

Abstract: Summary
Background
The COVID-19 pandemic is having profound mental health consequences for many people. Concerns have been expressed that, at their most extreme, these consequences could manifest as increased suicide rates. We aimed to assess the early effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on suicide rates around the world.
Methods
We sourced real-time suicide data from countries or areas within countries through a systematic internet search and recourse to our networks and the published literature. Between Sept 1 and Nov 1, 2020, we searched the official websites of these countries’ ministries of health, police agencies, and government-run statistics agencies or equivalents, using the translated search terms “suicide” and “cause of death”, before broadening the search in an attempt to identify data through other public sources. Data were included from a given country or area if they came from an official government source and were available at a monthly level from at least Jan 1, 2019, to July 31, 2020. Our internet searches were restricted to countries with more than 3 million residents for pragmatic reasons, but we relaxed this rule for countries identified through the literature and our networks. Areas within countries could also be included with populations of less than 3 million. We used an interrupted time-series analysis to model the trend in monthly suicides before COVID-19 (from at least Jan 1, 2019, to March 31, 2020) in each country or area within a country, comparing the expected number of suicides derived from the model with the observed number of suicides in the early months of the pandemic (from April 1 to July 31, 2020, in the primary analysis).
Findings
We sourced data from 21 countries (16 high-income and five upper-middle-income countries), including whole-country data in ten countries and data for various areas in 11 countries). Rate ratios (RRs) and 95% CIs based on the observed versus expected numbers of suicides showed no evidence of a significant increase in risk of suicide since the pandemic began in any country or area. There was statistical evidence of a decrease in suicide compared with the expected number in 12 countries or areas: New South Wales, Australia (RR 0·81 [95% CI 0·72–0·91]); Alberta, Canada (0·80 [0·68–0·93]); British Columbia, Canada (0·76 [0·66–0·87]); Chile (0·85 [0·78–0·94]); Leipzig, Germany (0·49 [0·32–0·74]); Japan (0·94 [0·91–0·96]); New Zealand (0·79 [0·68–0·91]); South Korea (0·94 [0·92–0·97]); California, USA (0·90 [0·85–0·95]); Illinois (Cook County), USA (0·79 [0·67–0·93]); Texas (four counties), USA (0·82 [0·68–0·98]); and Ecuador (0·74 [0·67–0·82]).
Interpretation
This is the first study to examine suicides occurring in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic in multiple countries. In high-income and upper-middle-income countries, suicide numbers have remained largely unchanged or declined in the early months of the pandemic compared with the expected levels based on the pre-pandemic period. We need to remain vigilant and be poised to respond if the situation changes as the longer-term mental health and economic effects of the pandemic unfold.

Abstract: Background
HIV-positive people who inject drugs (PWID) experience stigma related to their substance use and HIV, with adverse consequences to their health care utilization and mental health. To help affected individuals cope with their intersectional stigma and reduce its negative impact on health and health care, we adapted a behavioral stigma coping intervention for this HIV key population.
Objective
To conduct a randomized controlled trial (RCT) testing the ‘Stigma Coping to Reduce HIV risks and Improve substance use Prevention and Treatment’ (SCRIPT) intervention, a community-based, adapted form of Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT), for PWID living with HIV in St. Petersburg, Russia.
Methods
We recruited 100 PWID living with HIV from civil society organizations (CSO) delivering harm reduction and HIV prevention services in St. Petersburg, Russia. We randomized participants 2:1 to receive either the intervention (three adapted ACT sessions in a group format over one month and usual CSO care) or usual CSO care alone. ACT aims to help affected individuals cope with stigma by increasing their psychological flexibility to handle stigma-related negative expectations, emotions and experiences. The primary outcomes were satisfaction with the intervention, and changes in HIV and substance use stigma scores.
Conclusions
Stigma coping interventions targeting HIV-positive PWID outside of formal health care settings may help them confront negativities in their lives originating from intersectional stigma and reduce stigma's impact as a health care barrier.

Abstract: Mutations in the glucocerebrosidase gene (GBA) encoding the lysosomal enzyme glucocerebrosidase (GCase) cause Gaucher disease (GD) and are the most commonly known genetic risk factor for Parkinson disease (PD). Ambroxol is one of the most effective pharmacological chaperones of GCase. Fourteen GD patients, six PD patients with mutations in the GBA gene (GBA-PD), and thirty controls were enrolled. GCase activity and hexosylsphingosine (HexSph) concentration were measured in dried blood and macrophage spots using liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry. The effect of ambroxol on GCase translocation to lysosomes was assessed using confocal microscopy. The results showed that ambroxol treatment significantly increased GCase activity in cultured macrophages derived from patient blood monocytic cell (PBMC) of GD (by 3.3-fold) and GBA-PD patients (by 3.5-fold) compared to untreated cells (p < 0.0001 and p < 0.0001, respectively) four days after cultivation. Ambroxol treatment significantly reduced HexSph concentration in GD (by 2.1-fold) and GBA-PD patients (by 1.6-fold) (p < 0.0001 and p < 0.0001, respectively). GD macrophage treatment resulted in increased GCase level and increased enzyme colocalization with the lysosomal marker LAMP2. The possible binding modes of ambroxol to mutant GCase carrying N370S amino acid substitution at pH 4.7 were examined using molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulations. The ambroxol position characterized by minimal binding free energy was observed in close vicinity to the residue, at position 370. Taken together, these data showed that PBMC-derived macrophages could be used for assessing ambroxol therapy response for GD patients and also for GBA-PD patients.

Abstract: Rationale & Objective
Hemodialysis (HD) is the most common form of kidney replacement therapy. This study aimed to examine the use, availability, accessibility, affordability, and quality of HD care worldwide.
Study Design
A cross-sectional survey.
Setting & Participants
Stakeholders (clinicians, policy makers, and consumer representatives) in 182 countries were convened by the International Society of Nephrology from July to September 2018.
Outcomes
Use, availability, accessibility, affordability, and quality of HD care.
Analytical Approach
Descriptive statistics.
Results
Overall, representatives from 160 (88%) countries participated. Median country-specific use of maintenance HD was 298.4 (IQR, 80.5-599.4) per million population (pmp). Global median HD use among incident patients with kidney failure was 98.0 (IQR, 81.5-140.8) pmp and median number of HD centers was 4.5 (IQR, 1.2–9.9) pmp. Adequate HD services (3-4 hours 3 times weekly) were generally available in 27% of low-income countries. Home HD was generally available in 36% of high-income countries. 32% of countries performed monitoring of patient-reported outcomes; 61%, monitoring of small-solute clearance; 60%, monitoring of bone mineral markers; 51%, monitoring of technique survival; and 60%, monitoring of patient survival. At initiation of maintenance dialysis, only 5% of countries used an arteriovenous access in almost all patients. Vascular access education was suboptimal, funding for vascular access procedures was not uniform, and copayments were greater in countries with lower levels of income. Patients in 23% of the low-income countries had to pay >75% of HD costs compared with patients in only 4% of high-income countries.
Limitations
A cross-sectional survey with possibility of response bias, social desirability bias, and limited data collection preventing in-depth analysis.
Conclusions
In summary, findings reveal substantial variations in global HD use, availability, accessibility, quality, and affordability worldwide, with the lowest use evident in low- and lower-middle–income countries.

Abstract: ABSTRACT
The prognosis of acute leukemia refractory to induction chemotherapy or immunotherapy is dismal. Salvage allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is widely used option for these patients, but only 10% to 15% of patients are cured by the procedure. Preclinical studies indicate that substitution of post-transplantation cyclophosphamide with bendamustine (PTB) in a prophylaxis regimen may be associated with an augmented graft-versus-leukemia (GVL) reaction. The aim of this study was to establish the optimal dose of PTB and evaluate the antileukemic effect of HSCT with this type of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis. In the prospective trial (NCT02799147), PTB was administered in doses of 140, 100, and 70 mg/m2 on days +3 and +4. Myeloablative conditioning with fludarabine and oral busulfan was provided to all patients. The first 12 patients received single-agent PTB, and subsequent patients received combination therapy with tacrolimus and mycophenolate mofetil (MMF). Inclusion criteria were acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) or acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) refractory to at least one induction course of chemotherapy or target therapy and ≥5% clonal blasts in the bone marrow. The study cohort comprised 22 patients with AML and 5 with ALL. Seven patients were enrolled in the 140 mg/m2 group (due to a stopping rule), and 10 each were enrolled in the 100 mg/m2 and 70 mg/m2 groups. Primary refractory disease was documented in 41% of the patients, and secondary refractory was documented in 59%. The median blast count in the bone marrow at the start of the conditioning was 18% (range, 6% to 97%). Transplantation was performed with a matched sibling donor in 5 patients, a matched or mismatched unrelated donor in 15, and a haploidentical donor in 7. Engraftment was documented in 93% of the patients, including 89% with complete remission and 63% without measurable residual disease. After PTB prophylaxis, we observed an unusual complication, a cytokine release syndrome (CRS), in 70% of the patients, including grade 3 to 5 CRS in 44%. The most frequent clinical symptoms included high fever in 67% of patients, abnormal liver function tests in 67%, pancreatitis in 63%, skin vasculitis in 56%, enterocolitis in 48%, inflammation of oral mucosa in 37%, disseminated intravascular coagulation in 37%, and central nervous system toxicity in 26%. The development of CRS was associated with use of an HLA-mismatched donor (75% versus 20%; P = .0043). Classic acute GVHD was documented in 44% of the patients. Grade II-IV acute GVHD was associated with grade 3 to 5 CRS (67% versus 25%; P = .031). Moderate and severe chronic GVHD in the 100-day survivors were more often observed after single-agent PTB than after the combination immunosuppression (100% versus 18%; P = .002). A relatively low relapse rate was observed for this patient population. Three-year overall survival was 28% (95% confidence interval [CI], 13% to 46%), and event-free survival was 29% (95% CI, 13% to 46%). Nonrelapse mortality was 46% (95% CI, 25% to 64%), and the cumulative incidence of relapse was 26% (95% CI, 11% to 44%). No relapses were documented after day +100. There were no statistically significant differences among the dose groups (P = .3481); however, survival was higher in the 100 mg/kg group. Survival was higher in patients with AML compared with those with ALL (35% versus 0%; P = .0157). PTB represents a promising option to augment the GVL effect in refractory AML; however, the high CRS-associated mortality necessitates additional studies to reduce the risk of this complication. Thus, routine clinical application of PTB cannot be currently recommended. Combination immunosuppression with tacrolimus and MMF partially ameliorates these complications, at least in the setting of HLA-matched allografts. Biological mechanisms of CRS and GVL after PTB require further elucidation.

Abstract: Previous studies have shown that patients diagnosed with schizophrenia (SCZ) have deficits in early visual processing, namely contrast processing. The brain-derived neurotropic factor (BDNF) is an important measure to investigate neuroplasticity in some visual functions like visual perception. In this study, we investigated the relationship between visual processing and BDNF levels in first-episode SCZ patients. Thirty-nine healthy controls and 43 first-episode SCZ patients were enrolled. Contrast sensitivity measurements were conducted using low, mid- and high spatial frequencies. First-episode SCZ patients had higher contrast sensitivity than healthy controls for all frequencies, except for the middle spatial frequency. Negative correlations were found between BDNF, contrast sensitivity and clinical variables, mostly for middle and high spatial frequencies among females. Our results provide support for (i) the association of SCZ with alterations of magno- and parvocellular pathway functioning and (ii) decreased BDNF levels in first-episode SCZ patients. This study highlights the importance of using biomarkers along with other measures to investigate visual processing in SCZ and other disorders.

Abstract: Purpose
To analyze the 5-year biochemical disease-free survival (bDFS) and late toxicity profile in patients with prostate cancer treated with pencil beam scanning (PBS) proton radiation therapy.
Methods and Materials
Between January 2013 and March 2016, 284 patients with prostate cancer were treated using intensity modulated proton therapy (IMPT), with an ultrahypofractionated schedule (36.25 GyE in 5 fractions). Five patients were immediately lost from follow-up and thus were excluded from analysis. Data for 279 patients were prospectively collected and analyzed with a median follow-up time of 56.5 (range, 3.4-87.5) months. The mean age at time of treatment was 64.5 (40.1-85.7) years, and the median prostate-specific antigen (PSA) value was 6.35 μg/L (0.67-17.3 μg/L). A total of 121 (43.4%) patients had low-risk, 125 patients (44.8%) had favorable, and 33 (11.8%) unfavorable intermediate-risk cancer. In addition, 49 (17.6%) patients underwent neoadjuvant hormonal therapy, and no patients had adjuvant hormonal therapy. bDFS and late toxicity profiles were evaluated.
Results
The median treatment time was 9 days (range, 7-18 days). The 5-year bDFS was 96.9%, 91.7%, and 83.5% for the low-, favorable, and unfavorable intermediate-risk group, respectively. Late toxicity (Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events v.4) was as follows: gastrointestinal: grade 1, 62 patients (22%), grade 2, 20 patients (7.2%), and grade 3, 1 patient (0.36%); genitourinary: grade 1, 80 patients (28.7%), grade 2, 14 patients (5%), and grade 3, 0 patients. PSA relapse was observed in 17 patients (6.1%), and lymph node or bone recurrence was detected in 11 patients. Four (1.4%) local recurrences were detected. Nine patients (3.2%) died of causes unrelated to prostate cancer. No deaths related to prostate cancer were reported.
Conclusion
Ultrahypofractionated proton beam radiation therapy for prostate cancer is effective with long-term bDFS comparable with other fractionation schedules and with minimal serious long-term GI and GU toxicity.

Abstract: Cajal-Retzius cells are one of the transient elements of the developing cerebral cortex. These cells express some characteristic molecules. One of them, heavy-chain neurofilaments, participating in the construction of the mature cerebral networks, are believed to be a specific feature of the human’s Cajal-Retzius cells. Using histochemical stain for SMI-32 antibody to the non-phosphorylated heavy-chain neurofilaments, large neurons having horizontally oriented soma and bipolar processes were labeled in the molecular layer of the primary visual cortex of cats aged 0–2 postnatal days. Using DiI technique, similar neurons having a well-developed system of parallel vertical branches coming from the two horizontal processes were visualized in these areas. The location and general morphology of these neurons were similar to the Cajal-Retzius cells allowing to suppose for the carnivores to share similar with primates developmental mechanisms of the corticogenesis.

Abstract: In recent decades, semiconductor lasers have been successfully used in rhinology. However, their usage in the reduction of the nasal swell body (NSB) is barely studied. Our research aimed to conduct an experimental selection of the laser exposure mode in the NSB zone using a 970 nm diode laser for safe and effective NSB reduction. The thermometric parameters of a diode laser with a wavelength of 970 nm were evaluated in a continuous contact mode of exposure at the power from 2 W to 10 W with 2 W step. The laser was targeted at the liver of cattle, given its similar optical properties to the NSB region. After a series of experiments with every power rate and the analysis of temperature data, we estimated an optimal exposure mode at a power of 4 W. The collected thermometric data demonstrate the safety of this mode in a clinical setting for NSB reduction due to causing no thermal damage to the adjacent tissue. Based on the experiment, a technique for laser reduction of the NSB was developed to improve nasal breathing in patients with severe hypertrophy of this area. The proposed technique was applied to 39 patients with chronic vasomotor rhinitis and the NSB. All patients were divided into 2 groups. Group 1 consisted of 20 patients who underwent surface contact laser-turbinectomy and the NSB reduction using a 970 nm diode laser. Group 2 included 19 patients with the same pathology who underwent laser-turbinectomy, without reduction of the NSB. No statistically significant difference was observed during the dynamic observation with an objective assessment of nasal respiration according to active anterior rhinomanometry when comparing these subgroups with each other according to the t-criterion for independent samples (p > 0.05). As a result of comparing the data obtained on the NOSE scale using the Student's t-test, a statistically significant difference is observed (p < 0.001). Thus, patients who did not perform the reduction of the NSB subjectively noted the insufficiency of nasal breathing. This fact indicates that the NSB is involved in the regulation of airflow.

Abstract: Trace amine-associated receptors (TAARs) are a class of sensory G protein-coupled receptors that detect biogenic amines, products of decarboxylation of amino acids. The majority of TAARs (TAAR2-TAAR9) have been described mainly in the olfactory epithelium and considered to be olfactory receptors sensing innate odors. However, there is recent evidence that one of the members of this family, TAAR5, is expressed also in the limbic brain areas receiving projection from the olfactory system and involved in the regulation of emotions. In this study, we further characterized a mouse line lacking TAAR5 (TAAR5 knockout, TAAR5-KO mice) that express beta-galactosidase mapping TAAR5 expression. We found that in TAAR5-KO mice the number of dopamine neurons, the striatal levels of dopamine and its metabolites, as well as striatal levels of GDNF mRNA, are elevated indicating a potential increase in dopamine neuron proliferation. Furthermore, an analysis of TAAR5 beta-galactosidase expression revealed that TAAR5 is present in the major neurogenic areas of the brain such as the subventricular zone (SVZ), the subgranular zone (SGZ) and the less characterized potentially neurogenic zone surrounding the 3rd ventricle. Direct analysis of neurogenesis by using specific markers doublecortin (DCX) and proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) revealed at least 2-fold increase in the number of proliferating neurons in the SVZ and SGZ of TAAR5-KO mice, but no such markers were detected in mutant or control mice in the areas surrounding the 3rd ventricle. These observations indicate that TAAR5 involved not only in regulation of emotional status but also adult neurogenesis and dopamine transmission. Thus, future TAAR5 antagonists may exert not only antidepressant and/or anxiolytic action but may also provide new treatment opportunity for neurodegenerative disorders such as Parkinson's disease.

Abstract: The present study investigates hemispheric asymmetry of the ERPs and low-frequency oscillatory responses evoked in both hemispheres of the brain by the sound stimuli with delayed onset of motion. EEG was recorded for three patterns of sound motion produced by changes in interaural time differences. Event-related spectral perturbation (ERSP) and inter-trial phase coherence (ITC) were computed from the time-frequency decomposition of EEG signals. The participants either read books of their choice (passive listening) or indicated the sound trajectories perceived using a graphic tablet (active listening). Our goal was to find out whether the lateralization of the motion-onset response (MOR) and oscillatory responses to sound motion were more consistent with the right-hemispheric dominance, contralateral or neglect model of interhemispheric asymmetry. Apparent dominance of the right hemisphere was found only in the ERSP responses. Stronger contralaterality of the left hemisphere corresponding to the “neglect model” of asymmetry was shown by the MOR components and by the phase coherence of the delta-alpha oscillations. Velocity and attention did not change consistently the interhemispheric asymmetry of both the MOR and the oscillatory responses. Our findings demonstrate how the lateralization pattern shown by the MOR potential was interrelated with that of the motion-related single-trial measures.

Abstract: Background
Antibodies to the aquaporin-4 (AQP4) water channel in neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD) are reported to trigger the complement cascade, which is implicated in astrocyte damage and subsequent neuronal injury. The PREVENT study demonstrated that the terminal complement inhibitor eculizumab reduces adjudicated relapse risk in patients with anti-AQP4 immunoglobulin G-positive (AQP4+) NMOSD. The objective of this analysis was to evaluate the efficacy of eculizumab in reducing relapse risk and its safety in AQP4+ NMOSD across clinically relevant subgroups in PREVENT.
Methods
In the randomized, double-blind, time-to-event, phase 3 PREVENT trial, 143 adults received eculizumab (maintenance dose, 1200 mg/2 weeks) or placebo (2:1), with stable-dose concomitant immunosuppressive therapy (IST) permitted (except rituximab and mitoxantrone). Post hoc analyses of relapses and adverse events were performed for prespecified and post hoc subgroups based on concomitant IST and prior rituximab use, demographic and disease characteristics, and autoimmune comorbidity.
Results
The significant reduction in relapse risk observed for eculizumab versus placebo in the overall PREVENT population was consistently maintained across subgroups based on concomitant IST and previous rituximab use, age, sex, region, race, time since clinical onset of NMOSD, historical annualized relapse rate, baseline Expanded Disability Status Scale score, and history of another autoimmune disorder. The serious infection rate was lower with eculizumab than placebo regardless of rituximab use in the previous year, concomitant IST use, or history of another autoimmune disorder.
Conclusion
Across a wide range of clinically relevant AQP4+ NMOSD patient subgroups in PREVENT, eculizumab therapy was consistently effective versus placebo in reducing relapse risk, with no apparent increase in serious infection rate.

Abstract: Carboxylated light fullerenes, in particular, tris-malonate of fullerene C60 (C60[C(COOH)2]3, CF), is of great interest for studying its effect on plants, primarily as a source of malonate, a substance with high biological activity, and possible means of improving crop yield and its quality. Impact of water-soluble carboxylated light fullerene derivatives on physiological plant state is not studied enough. The present paper is devoted to the study of the carboxylated fullerene C60[C(COOH)2]3 influence on the physiological state, growth and netto productivity of salad, tomatoes, spring barley, and wheat in the initial stages of seed germination and in the vegetative period of plants development due to the following reasons: an increase in the absorption and assimilation capacity of roots and aerial parts of plants; increased absorption of moisture by plants, and other substances in the plant aerial organs; the entering into the plants and distributing C60[C(COOH)2]3 in the organs, containing physiologically active organic compounds, potentially involved in cyclic processes of plants catabolism; optimising the antioxidant system function. Our study shows that, according to the complex of estimated indicators of seed response and seedling condition, the C60[C(COOH)2]3 solutions in the concentration range CCF = 0.001–0.1 mg·dm−3 have a positive effect on test plants.

Abstract: Rationale & Objective
Approximately 11% of people with kidney failure worldwide are treated with peritoneal dialysis (PD). This study examined PD use and practice patterns across the globe.
Study Design
A cross-sectional survey.
Setting & Participants
Stakeholders including clinicians, policy makers, and patient representatives in 182 countries convened by the International Society of Nephrology between July and September 2018.
Outcomes
PD use, availability, accessibility, affordability, delivery, and reporting of quality outcome measures.
Analytical Approach
Descriptive statistics.
Results
Responses were received from 88% (n=160) of countries and there were 313 participants (257 nephrologists [82%], 22 non-nephrologist physicians [7%], 6 other health professionals [2%], 17 administrators/policy makers/civil servants [5%], and 11 others [4%]). 85% (n=156) of countries responded to questions about PD. Median PD use was 38.1 per million population. PD was not available in 30 of the 156 (19%) countries responding to PD-related questions, particularly in countries in Africa (20/41) and low-income countries (15/22). In 69% of countries, PD was the initial dialysis modality for≤10% of patients with newly diagnosed kidney failure. Patients receiving PD were expected to pay 1% to 25% of treatment costs, and higher (>75%) copayments (out-of-pocket expenses incurred by patients) were more common in South Asia and low-income countries. Average exchange volumes were adequate (defined as 3-4 exchanges per day or the equivalent for automated PD) in 72% of countries. PD quality outcome monitoring and reporting were variable. Most countries did not measure patient-reported PD outcomes.
Limitations
Low responses from policy makers; limited ability to provide more in-depth explanations underpinning outcomes from each country due to lack of granular data; lack of objective data.
Conclusions
Large inter- and intraregional disparities exist in PD availability, accessibility, affordability, delivery, and reporting of quality outcome measures around the world, with the greatest gaps observed in Africa and South Asia.

Abstract: Objective
To compare the effectiveness of two different treatment regimens of dydrogesterone in the management of endometriosis-related chronic pelvic pain.
Design
Observational, prospective cohort study over six months.
Setting
Twenty gynecology clinics in the Russian Federation.
Patient(s)
Three hundred fifty women from 18 to 45 years of age with endometriosis and chronic pelvic pain with or without dysmenorrhea.
Intervention(s)
Dydrogesterone 10 mg 2 or 3 times daily, either between the 5th and 25th days of the menstrual cycle (prolonged cyclical treatment regimen) or continuously (continuous treatment regimen). For all patients, the data cutoff was at six months of treatment.
Main Outcome Measure(s)
Intensity of chronic pelvic pain on the 11-point numerical rating scale (after 6 months).
Result(s)
A marked reduction in chronic pelvic pain was observed with both the prolonged cyclical and continuous treatment regimens (mean ± standard deviation change from baseline –3.3 ± 2.2 and –3.0 ± 2.2, respectively), with no significant difference between the two groups. With both regimens, patients experienced significant improvements in the intensity of chronic pelvic pain, number of days in which analgesics were required, severity of dysmenorrhea, sexual well-being, and health-related quality-of-life parameters. A favorable safety profile of dydrogesterone was confirmed, and no serious adverse drug reactions were reported during the study.
Conclusion(s)
Prolonged cyclical and continuous treatment regimens of dydrogesterone therapy both demonstrated a pronounced and similar reduction in the severity of chronic pelvic pain and dysmenorrhea and led to marked improvements in all study parameters related to quality of life and sexual well-being.

Abstract: Summary
Background
Novel adjuvant strategies are needed to optimise outcomes after complete surgical resection in patients with early-stage non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). We aimed to evaluate adjuvant atezolizumab versus best supportive care after adjuvant platinum-based chemotherapy in these patients.
Methods
IMpower010 was a randomised, multicentre, open-label, phase 3 study done at 227 sites in 22 countries and regions. Eligible patients were 18 years or older with completely resected stage IB (tumours ≥4 cm) to IIIA NSCLC per the Union Internationale Contre le Cancer and American Joint Committee on Cancer staging system (7th edition). Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) by a permuted-block method (block size of four) to receive adjuvant atezolizumab (1200 mg every 21 days; for 16 cycles or 1 year) or best supportive care (observation and regular scans for disease recurrence) after adjuvant platinum-based chemotherapy (one to four cycles). The primary endpoint, investigator-assessed disease-free survival, was tested hierarchically first in the stage II–IIIA population subgroup whose tumours expressed PD-L1 on 1% or more of tumour cells (SP263), then all patients in the stage II–IIIA population, and finally the intention-to-treat (ITT) population (stage IB–IIIA). Safety was evaluated in all patients who were randomly assigned and received atezolizumab or best supportive care. IMpower010 is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02486718 (active, not recruiting).
Findings
Between Oct 7, 2015, and Sept 19, 2018, 1280 patients were enrolled after complete resection. 1269 received adjuvant chemotherapy, of whom 1005 patients were eligible for randomisation to atezolizumab (n=507) or best supportive care (n=498); 495 in each group received treatment. After a median follow-up of 32·2 months (IQR 27·4–38·3) in the stage II–IIIA population, atezolizumab treatment improved disease-free survival compared with best supportive care in patients in the stage II–IIIA population whose tumours expressed PD-L1 on 1% or more of tumour cells (HR 0·66; 95% CI 0·50–0·88; p=0·0039) and in all patients in the stage II–IIIA population (0·79; 0·64–0·96; p=0·020). In the ITT population, HR for disease-free survival was 0·81 (0·67–0·99; p=0·040). Atezolizumab-related grade 3 and 4 adverse events occurred in 53 (11%) of 495 patients and grade 5 events in four patients (1%).
Interpretation
IMpower010 showed a disease-free survival benefit with atezolizumab versus best supportive care after adjuvant chemotherapy in patients with resected stage II–IIIA NSCLC, with pronounced benefit in the subgroup whose tumours expressed PD-L1 on 1% or more of tumour cells, and no new safety signals. Atezolizumab after adjuvant chemotherapy offers a promising treatment option for patients with resected early-stage NSCLC.
