Bandit-masked raccoons are a familiar sight just about everywhere, 
because they will eat just about anything. 
These ubiquitous mammals are found in forests, marshes, prairies, and even in cities. 
They are adaptable and use their dexterous front paws and long fingers to find and feast on a wide variety of fare.
